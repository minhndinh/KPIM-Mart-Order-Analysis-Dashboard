# 📦 KPIM Mart Order Analysis Dashboard
> Capstone Project · December 2025

## Overview
An interactive Order Analysis dashboard built in Power BI to monitor order fulfillment status, delivery performance, and workload distribution from high-level KPIs down to individual managers and product groups.

## Goals
This dashboard helps the logistics team in three key ways:
- **Real-time visibility into order progress** — see exactly where orders are stuck (placed but not shipped, shipped but not yet delivered), broken down by manager and product category
- **Performance tracking** — monitor trends in completion rates, average order value, average items per order, and workload over time
- **Status comparison** — count orders across all delivery statuses (Placed, Shipped, Paid) within the same reporting period for a clear side-by-side view
